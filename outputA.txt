The Sick Lion 


A lion, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself with
food by force, resolved to do so by artifice.  He returned to his den,
and lying down there, pretended to be sick, taking care that his
sickness should be publicly known.  The beasts expressed their sorrow,
and came one by one to his den, where the Lion devoured them.  After
many of the beasts had thus disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick
and presenting himself to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave,
at a respectful distance, and asked him how he was.  "I am very
middling," replied the Lion, "but why do you stand without? Pray enter
within to talk with me."  "No, thank you," said the Fox.  "I notice
that there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but I see no
trace of any returning."
The Wolf and the Lamb


  Once upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside, when,
looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to drink a
little lower down.  "There's my supper," thought he, "if only I can
find some excuse to seize it."  Then he called out to the Lamb, "How
dare you muddle the water from which I am drinking?"

  "Nay, master, nay," said the Lamb; "if the water be muddy up there,
I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to me."

  "Well, then," said the Wolf, "why did you call me bad names this
time last year?"

  "That cannot be," said the Lamb; "I am only six months old."

  "I don't care," snarled the Wolf; "if it was not you it was your
father;" and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb ate her all
up.  But before she died she gasped out.


	"Any excuse will serve a tyrant."
The Wolves and the Sheep 


  "WHY SHOULD there always be this fear and slaughter between us?"
said the Wolves to the Sheep.  "Those evil-disposed Dogs have much to
answer for.  They always bark whenever we approach you and attack us
before we have done any harm.  If you would only dismiss them from
your heels, there might soon be treaties of peace and reconciliation
between us."  The Sheep, poor silly creatures, were easily beguiled
and dismissed the Dogs, whereupon the Wolves destroyed the unguarded
flock at their own pleasure.
